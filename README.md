# TourBooking
This project is created for the Advanced Programming Subject for my Higher National Diploma.
This Tour Booking program allow customers to book the tour package of their desire and see their booked packages and cost. The program allow admins to create,update,view and delete packages and customer information.

## How it works
To log in as the admin, the user must enter the hardcoded credentials (Usn-Admin / Pw - Admin!@#). The admin can perform various operations such as creating, updating, viewing, deleting tour packages and customers.
To log in as the customer, the customer must first be created by the admin and afterwards, they can log in with the registered credentials. The customer can view and book the tour packages as well as view the list of packages they have booked.

## How it is made
It is created with Java using Object-Oriented Programming with the implementation of multiple design patterns such as composite, template, state patterns, etc.

## Lesson Learned
While it has multiple bugs and errors that were overlooked due to the time constraint of the assignment, it served as a great basis for my programming knowledge and how to design a program.
